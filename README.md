A professional portfolio CV website built from scratch using HTML and CSS Flexbox. Features include interactive hover effects and mobile-responsive layouts.
This repository contains my personal portfolio website built as part of my Computer Science coursework. The goal was to build a professional-grade CV from scratch without the use of pre-made templates.

## Key Technical Features
* **Custom Flexbox Layout**: Utilized CSS Flexbox for the header, skills section, and project grid to ensure a clean, organized structure.
* **Interactive UI**: Implemented CSS `transition` and `transform` properties to create smooth hover animations on all project cards and the profile picture.
* **Responsive Design**: Used CSS Media Queries (`@media`) to ensure the website is fully functional and readable on mobile devices.
* **Professional Styling**: Applied a consistent blue and white theme using custom CSS classes and IDs.

## Technologies Used
* HTML5 
* CSS3 
* GitHub 
* Vercel
